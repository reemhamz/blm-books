A project I wanted to embark on during the massive Black Lives Matter protests in June of 2020.

I used [Kay's](https://www.kaystocks.com/) BLM [resource list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEaf83TOkNnkLFsJpADyQlHd7aR216enJdkRqJpfc5k/edit) to know which books to add to this website.

Check out the live deploy [here](https://reemhamz.github.io/blm-books/)
